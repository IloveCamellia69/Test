								<h2>Field Review</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								This is a field review that I'm doing to get a
								better gauge on what current new websites are
								doing and to critique the websites to see what
								they're doing right or wrong. Since my target
								audience is Gen Z I will also look at these
								websites from my perspective to see what can be
								change, improved and worked on in order to try
								and get Gen Z reading the news and keeping up.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I started of with finding news sites to look at
								by searching “News websites” in google as it was
								the quickest way to get different selections and
								types of websites that people use. I took all
								the websites from the first page and opened them
								to get a first impression of the site. After
								opening them I’ve noticed that there were 3
								different types of sites that I can see from
								first impressions. Semi dense, dense, and
								pop-ups. Below I have linked and categorized
								them accordingly.
							</p>
							<br />
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>Semi dense</h2>
							</div>
							<img
								src="../images/week2/semi-dense.jpg"
								alt="Semi Dense websites"
							/>
							<p>
								These semi dense websites are in the name
								suggests, semi dense. They all have a nicely
								styled and laid out website giving each article
								their own space to sit in. This gives the
								impression that the articles presented are to a
								degree, somewhat important/daily headline(in my
								opinion/impression). This lends itself well to
								and small degree as based off of my research,
								Gen Z doesn't like to read a wall of text,
								something that isn't stylized or look nice. So
								applying the rule of 1/3s and overall visual
								style makes the website more appealing. However
								in saying that, Newsroom and Time both start to
								get into that dense category when scrolling down
								revealing compact layout making it feel like one
								mass of images and text with no end. This is the
								opposite for Vox. At first is a small section of
								dense compact headlines labeled “Top stories”.
								Then upon scrolling down articles are aligned in
								a single column of cards which makes things much
								easier to read and adds structure to the
								website.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								There are also very little to no ads on these
								websites. But this might be caused by my ad
								blockers.
							</p>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>Dense</h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<img
								src="../images/week2/dense.jpg"
								alt="Dense websties"
							/>
							<br />
							<p>
								The majority of the websites were categorized as
								dense because its just lots of information dump
								on so many different topics. This makes the
								website hard to easily read which drives away
								Gen Z as they don’t like information being
								pushed to them also making hard to digest. This
								is a major pain points for Gen Z who are trying
								to get into reading the news but are having a
								hard time because the news websites aren’t
								designed to be visuals first.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Despite popular belief or is may just be me,
								there are little to no ads on these new sites.
								This may be caused by my ad blockers doing its
								job but this cant be overlooked. Ads are
								fundamentally intrusive. They can ruin the
								experience of the users when trying to find what
								they need on a website. This is also a major
								factor in driving people away from website.
								Theres little to no good things to say about
								these websites aside from they serve you all the
								information at once if thats what you're into.
								But that’s not what Gen Z is into.
							</p>
							<br />
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>Pop-ups</h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<img
								src="../images/week2/pop-ups.jpg"
								alt="Pop up websites"
							/>
							<br />
							<p>
								And lastly the pop-up site. Pop-ups act as a
								great way to get people to do something you want
								them to do. Like signing up to a news letter,
								become a subscriber, or serving an ad. The one
								glairing issue with pop-ups is that its also
								super intrusive. I almost ALT+ F4 and closed the
								site as soon as I opened it just out of
								habit/instinct of how much I disliked pop-up.
								Yes pop-up are really intrusive and stop you
								from doing what you want. But it doesn’t stop
								there, the pop-up actively try to get you to do
								something. From the research that I did Gen Z
								doesn’t like being told what to do by these
								websites.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Even if someone closes out the pop-up they will
								get bombarded with super dense information that
								the website presents all at once over whelming
								the user and potentially driving them away from
								the site.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								All these intrusive things like ads and pop-ups
								compound together on top of a compact and hard
								to read website layout put up may barriers to
								entry for users which is not what you want if
								you want people to be on your site.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								With the little attention span and high demands
								that Gen Z have its really hard to format news
								in a why that tells the full story while begin
								so short that some can read it in a few seconds.
								But another way to do things is to make the
								experience of reading the news better. Removing
								the pop-ups and ads help bring down the barriers
								of entry down, and a stylized/designed website
								with well thought out visual hierarchy, content
								presentation and format could increase the
								amount of the Gen Z audience reading news. But
								making a redesign isnt enough. Since most Gen Z
								are on social media, you would also have to
								design a easy, efficient and quick way to
								present the news on other social media platform
								as well, not just your own website.

								<h2>Solution formats:</h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<img
								src="../images/week2/social-media.jpg"
								alt="social-media"
							/>
							<br />
							<p>
								Tik Tok is one of if not the more popular social
								media apps in the word. It presents its content
								in a way here its short, easy to access, and
								addicting for all its users. With its format of
								presenting its content in a vertical format it
								allows the users to change through content with
								a simple swipe. However there is a problem with
								this. You don’t know what content is going to
								come next. But Tik Tok has a very powerful
								algorithm to serve content to its users ensuring
								that they stay on the app as long as possible.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This is now a proven format for serving content
								to its target audience. Yes scrolling content
								has been here for a long time but only now it
								has blown up in the size that it is now.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								There’s plenty of other platforms that have
								copied this format such as, Instagram reels and
								Youtube shorts to varying outcomes and user
								responses. But basing off of thag other major
								companies have used this format in their website
								i can say that this is a tested format of
								delivering short and quick content to its end
								users.

								<h2>Style research</h2>

							<br />
							<p>
								After creating the mood boards i wanted to see
								which one Gen Z liked the most. So i created a
								Form using google form to send to my friends who
								are of similar age.
							</p>
							<br />
							<img
								src="../images/week2/feedback.png"
								alt="style feedback"
							/>
							<br />
							<p>
								Style 1 feedback can be condensed down to how it
								looks more modern, a brand that has history, and
								clean/simple. From this the style that i would
								go for would be the style of stylescape 1 as
								from the form it seems that Gen Z prefers a more
								modern, a brand that has history, and
								clean/simple design.

								<h2>Site Map</h2>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p>Needs that must be met but the website:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>visually appealing design</li>
								<li>Presenting the news in a short format</li>
								<li>little to no intrusive ad / pop-ups</li>
								<li>way to share the news</li>
								<li>filter topics to users liking</li>
								<li>content catering</li>
							</ul>
							<br />
							<img
								src="../images/week2/site-map.jpg"
								alt="Site map"
							/>
							<br />
							<p>
								I need to make the site map small so that there
								would be no distractions from the main page.
								This is because Gen Z have a small attention
								show from my research so having them on the home
								page most of the time to consume the content is
								key.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								However there is still need for pages like
								sign-up, log-in, profile, topics and saved news.
								This facilitates user tracking and content
								catering to the interests that Gen Z have.
								Theres also a saved news feature to facilitate
								saving content and sharing it to friends later
								helping the app get more reach. Then the basic
								Headlines, latest and search function to filter
								out content. Then if interested it would lead
								into the full article.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This site map shows what i need from the website
								and what content i should put where. And in a
								why it also shows what user journeys could stem
								from the website.
