									Gen Z primarily consumes news via social
									media and online sources that are tailored
									to their interests. They prefer content that
									is highly visual, shareable, and relatable
									to their daily experiences.
								</p>
								<br />
								<img
									loading="lazy"
									src="../images/week1/source-1.jpg"
									alt="source-1"
								/>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										“Young people are primarily driven by
										progress and enjoyment in their lives,
										and this translates into what they look
										for in news.”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
									This shows that younger people mainly focus
									on what they want their lives to be instead
									for worrying about something on traditional
									news that might not have a big impact on
									their lives.
								</p>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										"much of the excitement and gravitas for
										younger people is on the periphery of
										the news space (infotainment, lifestyle,
										cultural, grassroots, bloggers and
										vloggers).”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
									Younger generations don’t actually look out
									for “news” but instead they tend to look at
									things more inline with how their current
									lifestyle is, or what they want their
									lifestyle to be. This leads back to the
									younger generations to seek out the news
									that would progress and improve their lives
									while also fulfilling their social and
									personal needs.
								</p>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										"In a simplified way, how news brands
										and young people view the role and value
										of news is different”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
									People who are not part of the current
									generation view news completely different
									then how Gen Z sees news. For example People
									who are older tend to see the news as whats
									going on the in the world. Where-as Gen Z
									consumes news if it interests them, weather
									its fun and engaging instead of what news is
									traditionally is meant to be for.
								</p>
								<br />
								<img
									loading="lazy"
									src="../images/week1/source-2.jpg"
									alt="source-2"
								/>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										"One could argue young people aren’t
										political or interested in what’s going
										on around them. (On the other hand,
										people regularly complain about how many
										social justice causes Gen Z is invested
										in and how one “can’t even speak anymore
										without being cancelled online.” But
										that’s a different topic entirely.)”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
									considering that Gen Zs d have an active
									hand in social justices causes and are
									mostly heavily invested in them, you could
									argue that its more about being apart of the
									news instead of witnessing is on the side.
									But on the other hand, most social justice
									causes are based on blind beliefs instead of
									it being based in fact, but but feeling.
								</p>
								<br />
								<p>
									Its as if Gen Z is prone to activism but
									only to the extent of it being online.
								</p>
								<br />
								<p>
									it does sometimes feel like that Gen Z are
									always online being apart of the native
									technology user era and only looking at what
									current, entertaining, and or sometimes
									blind belief with no logical base.
								</p>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										“Our parents and grandparents had a
										dedicated newspaper time slot allocated”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										“Younger generations, however,
										prefer snacking on their news, reading a
										little something whenever it happens or
										is convenient”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										“Having a huge, unorganised wall of
										information definitely does not invite
										people to spend money on a product.”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
									Information overload is a major aspect of
									serving information to Gen Z. They dont have
									the time to digested and summarize the wall
									of text thats given to them cause they would
									only look at something for a short amount of
									time due to the short attention span that
									Gen Z have. So making quick easy to digest
									information is one of the keys to getting
									Gen Z to consume what you want them to.
								</p>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										“Especially since the Trump era, the
										need for credible, unbiased, and
										fact-based reporting has grown more than
										ever. A big contributor to this is a
										diversity of opinions and a focus on
										unbiased reporting (in other words, the
										opposite of American breakfast TV).”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
									The glaring issue with main stream media is
									that its rooted in politics and they want to
									push an agenda on to its consumers without
									considering other facts and view points.
								</p>
								<br />

								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										“Google acknowledged it was becoming a
										less-favored search platform for Gen
										Zers.”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										"A similarly high percentage of Gen Z
										adults (13%) said they start researching
										major news events on YouTube. But news
										on YouTube doesn’t skew toward Gen Zers
										as heavily as news on TikTok does: 9% of
										adults start researching news events on
										the former, compared with just 2% for
										the latter. This speaks to how TikTok
										can help news brands make inroads with
										Gen Zers faster than other social
										platforms can.”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
									As social media emerged and taking over the
									world by storm and being adopted by younger
									generations as a source of entertainment, it
									has had a major impact on how people now
									consume content. With the easy access to
									social media younger people are less
									inclined to actually do out to seek news but
									instead just opening their social media and
									finding out what’s happening through that.
								</p>
								<br />
								<div class="quote">
									<span>ᐁ</span>
									<p>
										“It also shows why publishers including
										The New York Times and The Wall Street
										Journal have launched TikTok accounts
										within the past six months.” ”though
										many still aren’t very active.”
									</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
									Traditional media does make an effort into
									trying to be on social media platforms but
									lacks the consistency in news updates on
									said platforms. However there are also other
									factors to consider, such as if the social
									media account is performing well in engaging
									their target audience.
								</p>
								<br />
								<p>
									TikTok is becoming a major source of
									information and education for Generation Z,
									similar to how Google is for other age
									groups. TikTok's algorithm allows users to
									discover and learn new things through
									short-form videos, with topics ranging from
									politics to beauty and everything in
									between. As a result, many Gen Zers are
									turning to TikTok as a primary source of
									information and are finding it more
									accessible and engaging than traditional
									media. The article also highlights how this
									trend is affecting industries such as
									journalism and advertising, as they adapt to
									the changing ways in which younger
									generations consume content.
