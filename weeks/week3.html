								<h2>Prototypes</h2>
							</div>

							<p>
								After making the paper prototype and getting
								some feed back from users. I started to make
								turn those suggested changes from paper to
								digital prototypes.
							</p>

							<img
								src="../images/week3/moblie-proto.png"
								alt="moblie-prototype"
							/>
							<p>
								But after playing around with the digital lofi
								prototype the concept of the solution slowly
								started to change and evolve. It started off as
								a tik tok like format to make not liking how
								things were placed and then it slowly started to
								change in to a card like format. With this new
								format but still the same content. I mapped out
								what i wanted the new website to look like. It
								could have been from a simple website layout of
								having cards placed in a generic manner. Or i
								could also have gone, still a similer tik toc
								style of having the main content in a scrollable
								format like how the tik toks website it.
							</p>

							<img
								src="../images/week3/website-mockup.png"
								alt=""
							/>

							<p>
								In the end ive decided to do a mash between
								these two. There would be a main scrollable
								section in a grid format and on the side there
								would be the latest and head lines section. The
								main section would be dedicated to the content
								for the viewer or what the website thinks the
								viewer would like.
							</p>

							<p>
								I laid out the content too see if i liked the
								layout of the new design with the new cards and
								it turned out to look like a design website.
							</p>

							<p>
								When i did that i realized that the original
								idea didnt have a good identity for it because
								it was so based off of tik tok.
							</p>

							<img
								src="../images/week3/new_sitemap.png"
								alt="New site map"
							/>

							<p>
								When moving on to a different layout its also
								important to redo a new site map to fit the
								users needs. Keeping things minimal and simple
								allows for the website to focus in the things
								that matter like the cards and the articles
								themselves without any fluff.
							</p>

							<img
								src="../images/week3/website-test.png"
								alt="website test"
							/>

							<p>
								I moved onto creating a mid-fi prototype and
								fully creating a news dashboard. Ive created 2
								version of the but essentially its just the same
								thing with different pages. I did this to see
								how things would look.
							</p>

							<img
								src="../images/week3/mid-1.png"
								alt="Mid fi prototype"
							/>

							<img
								src="../images/week3/mid-2.png"
								alt="Mid fi prototype"
							/>

							<p>
								After creating both i just scrapped the first
								one in favour of the on with the most articles
								and profile. this is mainly because the overall
								design of the website since i wasnt planning on
								having a footer at the bottom of the page, but
								instead having the footer in the about page. Yes
								having the the about page for a ready to test
								prototype would be me crossing my eyes and
								dotting my Ts but i thought not having it would
								be a better representation of how the website
								would be for the target audience because there
								wouldnt be any need to have an about us because
								they might just not be interested in it at all.

								<h2>User testing</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>user 1</h2>
							</div>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Like the back and forward button on the
									articles Ease of access to the next article
								</li>
								<li>
									There should be a notification that tells
									you that you liked a article because. Slow
									Wi-Fi mainly for users needs
								</li>
								<li>
									Didn’t know that the content is scroll able
									should add one to indicate the there are
									more content
								</li>
								<li>
									They expected that if the user was not
									logged in that the layout of the website
									should change because there is no user data
									generated to give a “Your News section”
									different view for non registered users
								</li>
							</ul>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>user 2</h2>
							</div>
							<ul>
								<li>unexpected change in article</li>
								<li>scrollbar needed</li>
								<li>change like icon to save/bookmark icon</li>
								<li>click tag to show same type article</li>
								<li>article popup could be better</li>
							</ul>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>user 3</h2>
							</div>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Didn’t know that the “Your News” section can
									be scrolled
								</li>
								<li>
									felt that a category selector would be a
									nice to have for ease of finding the topic
									you like
								</li>
								<li>
									an article pop up would feel much more easy
									to use then a article page, or just a quick
									article peak
								</li>
								<li>no scroll indication</li>
								<li>
									next and back button is useful on articles
								</li>
							</ul>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>Testing synthesis:</h2>
							</div>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Scroll indication is needed This has been
									the one feedback that has been echoed out in
									all 3 of the user testing session making it
									the main issue that I need to fix.
								</li>
								<li>
									Article selector The article topic selector
									has also shown un in 2 of the 3 feedback
									sections. This was unexpected from the users
									end as they thought in the prototype that
									there would be that function but there
									wasn’t.
								</li>
								<li>
									Other from these 2 main things that have
									popped up in 2 or more user testing session
									the other feedback is also really useful for
									me to take in as they would represent some
									of the QoL things that a website might have
									the i didnt know about and should implement
								</li>
