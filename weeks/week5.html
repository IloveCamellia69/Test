								<h2>
									Crime and General bad behavior in the area:
								</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								First I decided to look at the news and see the
								extent of crime that happen in the area. Maybe
								look at google maps to also see what comes ups.
								Such as run down buildings, poorly maintained
								areas and such.
							</p>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>First off Royal heights:</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								Royal heights is a small shopping area with the
								bare essentials like a bakery, supermarket,
								laundromat, dollar store, etc etc.
							</p>

							<img
								src="../images/week5/carpark1.jpg"
								alt="carpark1"
							/>
							<p>
								At first glance when looking at this supermarket
								the exterior of the building it looks very old
								not maintained very well leaving to how it is
								now. When walking up to the supermarket entrance
								you see a lot of photos of people. Upon taking a
								closer look at it, its photos of people who have
								stolen from the supermarket and seemingly being
								publicly shamed for their actions and to try and
								get justice.
							</p>
							<p>
								Despite the previous supermarket not doing this
								it does give me a sense of security of not
								seeing the people who committed the crime and by
								having the pictures there made me feel that this
								place was more unsafe then i actually is.
							</p>
							<img
								src="../images/week5/carpark-glass.jpg"
								alt="Broken glass in carpark"
							/>
							<p>
								Things also don’t change much when it comes to
								the inside of the super market. When entering, i
								got meet with lots of boxes in the entrance.
								Although items were placed in their separate
								item shelves there’s also plenty of items on
								their own on standoffs.

								alt="Drinks"
							/>
							<p>
								Outside of the supermarket theres also shops in
								a similar start of a bit old and run down there
								also some properties that are unoccupied. Im
								assuming it maybe because its not worth it to
								open a shop here due it it not being profitable
								because people might not have the money to spend
								on things.

							/>
							<p>
								When looking at the stores here, ive noticed
								that there are only what I personally call
								skeleton stores. A Pharmacy, bakery, takeaway,
								post office, etc. It seems like that there are
								only the bare essentials for what constitutes as
								a small shopping center nothing more, nothing
								less.

								<h2>What may have caused this?</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								Well living in Massey comes with is not so great
								things ofc, the crime is what i assume is why
								massey is they way it is. Because crime is often
								hard for a student to document lets begin with
								looking at the news. When searching up news in
								Massey The first thing that comes us is a Massey
								section in the NZ herald and then 1 or 2
								articles from other news sources in the main
								search directory.
							</p>
							<img
								src="../images/week5/search-results.jpg"
								alt="Web Search results"
							/>
							<p>
								When looking through the NZ Herald articles the
								main thing that i noticed was that the majority
								of articles was about crime.
							</p>
							<img
								src="../images/week5/article1.jpg"
								alt="article1"
							/>
							<p>
								When looking at this its rather daunting to see
								that its only crime mentioned and hardly
								anything else. For me this does paint a dark
								picture on and in the area.
							</p>
							<p>
								Even looking at past news its mainly if not only
								about crime that happened in Massey. Its hard to
								say that this is a decently safe area for people
								to live.

								<h2>Second Westgate shopping center:</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								Westgate shopping center is a pretty much an
								open mall with shops surrounding a central
								carpark. This give people a great place to walk
								to get the things you need. Overall the place is
								pretty nice and well maintained. Though there is
								a weird public toilet in the middle of the car
								park.
							</p>
							<img
								src="../images/week5/westgate.jpg"
								alt="Westgate toilet"
							/>
							<p>
								This is a public toilet that costs 50cents to
								enter. I don’t know why but I assume its because
								the public toilets get ruined by people so they
								had to charge people to enter.
							</p>
							<p>
								In saying this, Westgate is a place technically
								outside of Massey and mainly consists of big
								brands and high end wares so I would expect the
								place to be much better.

								<h2>Stakeholders in this situation:</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								I think the main stakeholder for this area would
								be:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The police that have to deal with the
									trouble makers
								</li>
								<li>The people who commit the trouble</li>
								<li>
									Community workers that want to make the
									place better
								</li>
								<li>Elderly that lives in the area</li>
								<li>Small children and families</li>
