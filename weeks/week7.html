								<h2>Pecha Kucha Reflection:</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>Describe the experience?</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								The experience was presenting what I had created
								up until week 3 of summative 2, week 7 of the
								term.
							</p>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>
									Describe the feelings and thoughts you had
									about the experience?
								</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								Before the presentation I felt that I was
								woefully under prepared for what I was about to
								undertake and lack experience which doubled down
								on the fact that I was under prepared. During
								the presentation I felt anxious due to being
								under prepared. And when the presentation ended
								I felt relieved that it was over. my thoughts on
								this experience was, from the beginning, that I
								stumble on more then a fair share of my stuff
								and that the presentation wasn’t going to be
								that great. But after presenting and improvising
								everything, i felt really good that I got it
								over and done with as I did. In the end I
								thought it went pretty decently
							</p>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>
									What was good and bad about the experience?
								</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								What was good about the experience was that I
								knew my project well enough to not need anything
								to help me with the presentation. The bad thing
								was that I still hated presenting and didn’t
								want to do it so I became unprepared for it.
							</p>
							<div class="m-stubtitle">
								<h2>
									Why was it good or bad? Why did things
									happen this way?
								</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								It was goo for me to know my own project because
								with the base foundation of the project I can
								properly articulate what the project is about
								from my own mind without having to read it, or
								memorized it. Which leads to less confusion on
								what the solution was. This happened because I
								was the one who conducted the research of the
								project and the solution behind it. I knew who
								my target audience was and i know what their
								pain points are, so I was about to have a great
								understanding and how to communicate this
								understanding on a moments notice.
							</p>
							<div class="m-subtitle">
								<h2>
									What did you learn about this situation.
								</h2>
							</div>
							<p>
								I’ve learnt that even with little preparation
								for the presentation, you can still present your
								ideas and your research to back up these ideas
								if you put in the effort and actually doing
								things in a why where you understand it well
								enough to come to a good solution for the
								problem.
