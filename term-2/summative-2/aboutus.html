					<div class="about-text">
						<p>
							Introducing Forward/s by Burberry, where
							individualism and modernism converge in an
							extraordinary fashion fusion. Our journey began with
							a collective brainstorm, pondering how to align
							Burberry with the core values of streetwear.
						</p>
						<p>
							Delving into Burberry's iconic tan hues, symbolic of
							a bygone era of collectivism and patriotism, we
							recognized the need to infuse our brand with
							vibrant, captivating colors and patterns that
							resonate with streetwear's penchant for uniqueness.
						</p>
						<p>
							Drawing inspiration from the functional origins of
							the original Burberry trench coats, designed to
							brave the harshest British weather, we observed a
							kinship with techwear—a contemporary clothing style
							characterized by sleek black aesthetics, advanced
							materials, and integrated technology. Our aim was to
							pay homage to Burberry's heritage while embracing
							the cutting-edge fashion of today.
						</p>
						<p>
							Enter Forward/s by Burberry, a groundbreaking
							collection that combines hyper-functional techwear
							with an audacious interplay of captivating colors

					<h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
					<div class="history-text">
						<p>
							The history of techwear can be traced back to the
							early 20th century when advancements in textile
							technology and manufacturing techniques paved the
							way for the development of functional and innovative
							clothing. However, it wasn't until the late 20th
							century and early 21st century that techwear as a
							distinct fashion style began to emerge.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the 1980s and 1990s, outdoor apparel brands like
							The North Face and Patagonia introduced
							performance-focused clothing that incorporated
							advanced materials such as Gore-Tex, which offered
							waterproofing and breathability. These garments were
							primarily designed for outdoor activities like
							hiking, mountaineering, and skiing.
						</p>
						<p>
							The rise of urban streetwear in the late 1990s and
							early 2000s had a significant influence on the
							development of techwear. Streetwear brands like
							ACRONYM, Stone Island, and Y-3 (a collaboration
							between Yohji Yamamoto and Adidas) started
							incorporating technical fabrics, innovative design
							elements, and futuristic aesthetics into their
							collections. This fusion of fashion and
							functionality laid the foundation for the techwear
							style.
						</p>
						<p>
							The term "techwear" itself gained prominence in the
							2010s, as online communities and fashion enthusiasts
							began to use it to describe this emerging fashion
							trend. The rise of social media platforms and online
							forums provided a platform for individuals to share
							and discuss their interest in techwear, leading to
							increased visibility and popularity.
						</p>
						<p>
							Techwear's aesthetic and functional principles were
							heavily influenced by science fiction, cyberpunk
							literature, and dystopian visions of the future. The
							visual aesthetics of films like "Blade Runner" and
							"The Matrix" played a significant role in shaping
							the futuristic and utilitarian design elements of
							techwear.
						</p>
						<p>
							As the popularity of techwear grew, designers and
							brands started to push the boundaries of what was
							considered possible in clothing design. They began
							incorporating features such as modular components,
							hidden pockets, and integrated technology into their
							garments. This emphasis on innovation and
							functionality further solidified techwear as a
							distinct fashion category.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, techwear continues to evolve and expand, with
							designers exploring new materials, incorporating
							smart textiles, and experimenting with cutting-edge
							technologies. The style has garnered a dedicated
							following and has made its way into mainstream
							fashion, influencing not only streetwear but also
							high-end designer collections.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall, the history of techwear is a story of the
							intersection between fashion, technology, and
							functionality. It has evolved from humble beginnings
							in performance outdoor apparel to a fashion movement
							that blends futuristic aesthetics with advanced
							materials and design innovation.
